# PID 101

This repository contains a series of Python simulations and accompanying explanations exploring **PID control** in a variety of systems. The goal is to help engineering students and enthusiasts understand how PID controllers work, and how to implement them in code.

The series progresses in complexity:

1. **First-Order Systems**  
   - Simple DC motor speed control  
   - Translating PID equations from theory to Python  
   - Observing the role of P, I, and D terms

2. **Thermal Systems**  
   - Temperature control with heating and cooling dynamics  
   - Modeling first-order thermal processes  
   - Introducing environmental losses and setpoint tracking

3. **Open-Loop vs Closed-Loop Comparison**  
   - Demonstrates why feedback is critical  
   - PID control vs fixed-input heating  
   - Observing overshoot, steady-state error, and system response

4. **Spring–Mass–Damper Systems**  
   - Simulating second-order dynamics  
   - State-space representation and discrete-time simulation  
   - Setting the stage for advanced control methods like LQR

# About
This repository is intended for learning and demonstration purposes. Each simulation is accompanied by code comments explaining the PID implementation and system dynamics.
Feel free to experiment with the parameters, try different PID gains, or extend the models to explore control systems further.
